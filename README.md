# TCLMF
Clinical drug response prediction from preclinical cancer cell lines by logistic matrix factorization approach

TCLMF is a computational method to predict log IC50 for tumor samples. This method is used in cancer drug sensitivity prediction, which is a fundamental issue in precision medicine. This repository contains the implemented codes of TCLMF, the preprocessed data and the computed similarity matrices for cell lines and drugs.
